<h2>The Understanding the Atom Series</h2>
<p>Nuclear energy is playing a vital role in the life of every
man, woman, and child in the United States today. In the
years ahead it will affect increasingly all the peoples of the
earth. It is essential that all Americans gain an understanding
of this vital force if they are to discharge thoughtfully their
responsibilities as citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission provides
this booklet to help you achieve such understanding.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>
<p>Thomas S. Osborne is in charge of plant-breeding research being
conducted by the University of Tennessee&rsquo;s Agricultural Research
Laboratory for the Atomic Energy Commission. He has been in
this work since 1953.</p>
<p>But Dr. Osborne is a teacher at heart. Hence when students
wrote inquiring about the effects of radiation on seeds, he took
great interest in replying. From these replies grew mimeographed
literature suggesting experiments for students; then this and other
booklets.</p>
<p>Dr. Osborne received his undergraduate degree from Oklahoma
State University and his doctorate from Washington State University.</p>

<p>by Thomas S. Osborne,
<br />Associate Professor of Agronomy, University of Tennessee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>To know what questions to put to Nature&mdash;that
is 95 per cent of scientific research.</i>
<span class="lr">&mdash;Whitehead</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If man&rsquo;s existence on the earth is compared to a calendar
year, then he began farming in the very early morning of
December 30 and began applying systematic knowledge to
agriculture at 10:15 p.m. on December 31.</p>
<p>The first traces of man on the earth are dated at about
one and three-quarter million years ago. Plant life then
was very much like plant life today, but the animal population
was quite different. Man became a producer of plants
and animals instead of merely a gatherer and hunter about
8000 years ago. He has applied systematic study to cultivated
plants and animals for only 300 years.</p>
<h2 id="c1">Research in the United States</h2>
<p>Estimates of crop losses in the United States each year
are approximately $5 billion to weeds, $4 billion to insects,
and $3 billion to diseases. This total loss of $12 billion a
year is about $22,500 a minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>In an effort to reduce these losses and to raise the standard
of living, agricultural research has become more specialized
and more complex. Over the years it has gradually
changed from trial-and-error attempts to increase production
to the actual study of basic questions. To study such
intricate systems as the leaf of a plant or the liver of an
animal, agricultural science has had to draw from every
other science. The use of radioactive tracers and radiations
in research looks especially promising to agriculture.</p>
<p>In fact, agriculture has already begun to benefit from the
applications of such research. Radioactive techniques have
been used to study soils, plants, microbes, insects, farm
animals, and new ways to use and preserve foodstuffs. Radioactive
atoms are not used directly by farmers but are
used in research directed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture
and Atomic Energy Commission, by the agricultural
experiment stations of the various states, and by numerous
public and private research institutions. From such research
come improved materials and methods which are
used on the farm.</p>
<p>In more highly developed countries agricultural research
has brought a shift of emphasis from production to utilization.
In the United States today, each farmer produces
enough food for himself and 25 other people. Moreover, for
every person who works on a farm, there are two or three
other people who sell him goods and services or process
and distribute the things he produces.</p>
<p>In agriculture, as in all areas of research, the number of
questions to be asked of Nature seems infinite. Future generations
seeking to answer these questions will probably
rely more on techniques using radioactive isotopes than on
any other methods known today.</p>
<h2 id="c2">How Are Radioisotopes Used in Research?</h2>
<h3 id="c3">They May Be Used as &ldquo;Tracers&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Man&rsquo;s attempts to describe the universe consist of finding
answers to the questions he puts to Nature:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How deep is a well? Toss in a rock.</p>
<p class="t0">Where is the cat? Hang a bell on him.</p>
<p class="t0">How far does a wild duck fly? Put a marker on his leg.</p>
<p class="t0">Where are the fireflies? Just watch at dusk.</p>
<p class="t0">Is our satellite still up? Listen for the radio signal.</p>
</div>
<p>Other questions arise in agricultural research:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How fast do roots grow? How deep? How soon does water get to them after a rain?</p>
<p class="t0">When does a mouthful of hay reach a cow&rsquo;s stomach?</p>
<p class="t0">How long until nutrients get into her blood? Her milk?</p>
<p class="t0">How far will pine pollen travel on the wind?</p>
<p class="t0">How deep does an earthworm burrow?</p>
</div>
<p>To answer these questions, scientists need some kind of
miniature genie, one who will shout at the proper moment,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; When the root has reached the fertilizer or the
water has reached the root; when the hay becomes transmuted
to milk, or the earthworm arrives at a particular
spot&mdash;then this invisible little servant who has made the
trip could announce, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a helpful genie exists as the radioactive atom: he is
invisibly small, obedient, transportable, digestible, immune
to fire, flood, or famine, able to travel under his invisible
cloak to the secret hiding places of Nature&rsquo;s creatures and
announce to waiting Geiger tubes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physically unstable radioactive atom behaves chemically
exactly like its stable counterpart until the instant it
emits its radiation and becomes stable. For example, radioactive
phosphorus behaves, biologically and chemically,
like stable phosphorus until it emits a beta particle and becomes
stable sulfur. If the beta particle enters a gas-filled
Geiger tube, it produces a tiny burst of electrical energy
which is registered by the counter.</p>
<p>Like fireflies which reveal themselves at dusk by flashes
of light, radioisotopes announce their numbers and locations
to sensitive Geiger tubes by flashes of invisible &ldquo;light.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c4">How Effective Are Radioactive Tracers?</h3>
<p>One way to see how valuable radioactive tracers are is to
compare them to standard chemical techniques. A sensitive
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
chemical test can perceive molecules as dilute as 10&#8315;&#8311;; that
is, it can detect a molecule surrounded by 10 million molecules
of another kind. A good radioactive tracer technique,
by comparison, can distinguish concentrations of 10&#8315;&sup1;&sup1;; that
is, it can trace one in 100 <span class="u">billion</span>.</p>
<p>In other words by the chemical test you could find a person
in metropolitan New York with a secret tattoo on the
roof of his mouth. By the tracer method you could find this
same person anywhere in the world, even if the world population
were multiplied fiftyfold.</p>
<p>In the chemical test you could distinguish the equivalent
of one kernel of corn in one-tenth of a boxcar load; in the
tracer, one kernel in 850 boxcars.</p>
<h2 id="c5">Plant Nutrition and Metabolism</h2>
<p>Most studies of plant nutrition and metabolism pertain to
the following questions. What do plants need for their best
growth? How do they take in the materials they need? What
things are absorbed by roots and what things by foliage?
How does the plant turn water and other simple compounds
into carbohydrates and proteins?</p>
<p>Specific problems that atomic energy has helped to solve
are listed.</p>
<h3 id="c6">What Happens to Fertilizer in the Soil?</h3>
<p>Early research indicated that only 10 to 12 per cent of
phosphorus fertilizers was taken up by plants in the first
year; the rest was &ldquo;locked into&rdquo; the soil or washed away.
With radioactive phosphorus-32 scientists found that as
much as 50 to 70 per cent of the phosphorus in a plant came
from the fertilizer during the first two or three weeks of
growth.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Do Plants Absorb Through Roots Only?</h3>
<p>Fertilizer applied to soil is largely wasted because it is
either bound by soil particles or is washed out of the root
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
zone. If chemical elements could go directly into leaves and
bypass the wastefulness of soils, a tremendous saving would
result.</p>
<p>Botanists have learned in recent years that the foliage of
plants can take in some nutrients much as roots can. With
tracers they discovered that many nutrients are readily
taken up by foliage, including bark of dormant trees, even at
temperatures below freezing. As shown by isotopic tracers,
elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium move
both up and down from the point of application at rates
similar to those following root absorption. Urea (a nitrogen
compound) is now used as a nutrient foliar spray for many
fruit and vegetable crops in this country.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Where Should Fertilizer Be Placed?</h3>
<p>Even before the use of tracers, agronomists realized the
inefficiency of spreading fertilizer uniformly over a seed-bed.
They know the fertilizer should be placed somewhere
near the seed, but where? Above? Below? Beside? Below
and beside? How far away? They had conducted some research,
but the methods were slow and tedious.</p>
<p>Using tracers, the researchers confirmed earlier findings
that roots within two or three days reached fertilizer
placed less than two inches directly below seeds, but the
roots tended to congregate there. When the fertilizer was
two inches below and two inches to the side, roots reached
it within a week and a better root system developed. With
three inches between seeds and fertilizer, the desired seedling
&ldquo;boost&rdquo; was delayed three or four weeks. (See <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="c9">Do Fertilizers Move Fast in Plants?</h3>
<p>The movement of radioactive phosphorus from root to
leaf was found to be remarkably fast, sometimes requiring
less than twenty minutes. (See <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="c10">What Else Do Radioisotopes Tell Us?</h3>
<p>Some plants take in chemicals that the plant probably
cannot use: for example, the so-called locoweeds accumulate
enormous amounts of selenium. With tracer techniques,
we can see that the root uptake process has poor powers of
discrimination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p class="caption small" id="fig_1">Fig. 1&mdash;Soil tests tell <i>how much</i> of each fertilizer element is needed but not where to put it to give seedlings the much-needed &ldquo;push.&rdquo; With tracers it is found that:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Tracer experiments reveal that roots cannot distinguish
potassium (needed in large amounts) from other elements
which are chemically similar but quite different in size.
Once inside the plant, only potassium can be metabolized
and similar but heavier elements (rubidium, cesium) are
useless. This is like an absentminded builder who buys
brick, boulders, and gravel indiscriminately for his wall
and then finds he can use only part of his materials.</p>
<p>The process called photosynthesis whereby green plants
use energy from the sun to convert simple compounds from
air and soil into complex, energy-rich substances has been
termed the most important chemical reaction in the world.
It is the basis for man&rsquo;s entire food supply and, except for
nuclear energy, all significant fuel as well. Tracer techniques
have multiplied the research efforts on photosynthesis
tremendously.</p>
<p>When only chemical tests were available, food manufacturing
in green leaves had to progress for hours before
scientists could measure the products. But with tracers
and other new techniques they have narrowed the experimental
time to minutes and finally to seconds. Today they
know that a green leaf has formed sugars more complex
than fructose, &ldquo;fruit sugar,&rdquo; after exposure to light for only
<i>one second</i>!</p>
<p>When the incredible complexities of photosynthesis are
finally unraveled, radioactive tracers, especially radioactive
carbon-14, will have provided the significant clues.</p>
<h2 id="c11">Plant Diseases and Weeds</h2>
<h3 id="c12">How Can We Combat Plant Diseases?</h3>
<p>At one time to stop epidemic spread of plant diseases
was virtually impossible; farmers had to abandon fields and
crops. Such catastrophes caused by microbes have changed
the course of history. For example, the Irish famines of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the 1840&rsquo;s resulted from the potato blight and caused mass
emigrations from Ireland.</p>
<p>In this country today plant diseases result in losses estimated
at $3 billion a year. So far, the most economical
means of reducing the ravages of plant diseases has been
to breed resistant plant varieties. Although such a variety
may cost $100,000 to develop, its cost is usually repaid
within a year or two.</p>
<p>But the victory is only temporary. Although plants are
bred to resist the pathogen (fungus) of the moment, Nature
is constantly changing the microbial population by mutation
and hybridization. Within a few years virulent strains of
fungi which can attack the &ldquo;resistant&rdquo; variety increase to
such an extent that the new variety must be replaced.</p>
<p>For crops that provide high per-acre income such as
some vegetables and vine and tree fruits, chemical control
of fungous diseases is economically possible; in fact, it is
a real necessity. But such treatment is too costly for most
field crops, unless some cheap seed treatment or fertilizer
additive can be found.</p>
<p>A general breakthrough in control of plant diseases is
yet to come. Because of thousands of pathogenic species,
with hundreds of strains, it does not seem possible that the
following questions could be answered about each one. What
is the life cycle of the microbe? What conditions of temperature
and humidity encourage it to spread? What plant
species does it attack? How does it enter? What chemical
changes within the cells of the plant determine whether they
resist or succumb to the invader? How long can germs remain
potent? How far can they travel by wind or water?
What combination of resistant varieties, cultural methods,
and chemical treatment will control the disease?</p>
<p>With tracers it is possible for the first time to measure
chemical uptake in single spores and to follow chemicals
through the plant. Perhaps the most enlightening information
from such studies is that some fungicides are 10,000
times less effective per unit of &ldquo;body weight&rdquo; than are other
chemicals used to destroy weeds and insects. Obviously the
breakthrough in chemical control of plant diseases is yet to
come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c13">Why Do Chemicals Destroy Some Plants?</h3>
<p>Weeds cost this country an estimated $5 billion annually,
which is more than the loss to either plant diseases or insects.
Selective chemical weed killers such as &ldquo;2, 4-D&rdquo;
have become so widely used that more than $135 million
worth was sold in the United States in 1959. In proper concentration
these compounds will destroy many unwanted
plants without harming lawn grasses or crop plants.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_8">
<img src="images/pag008.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="600" />
<p class="caption small">Fig. 3&mdash;Tagged weed-killing chemicals (A) are taken in and transported alike in grassy (B) and broad-leaved (C) plants, but only in the latter are killed.</p>
</div>
<p>As in many other instances, beneficial use of the chemicals
has far outreached an understanding of how they work.
The still scanty knowledge of the process has come almost
entirely from tracer studies.</p>
<p>All plants readily absorb selective weed killers (&ldquo;herbicides&rdquo;),
which are not destroyed within the plants. Resistant
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
plants show no effect of the chemicals, but sensitive plants
suffer damage in actively growing roots and shoots. Sugar
formation during photosynthesis is disrupted in these plants,
and phosphorus movement is retarded. In order to predict
what new classes of chemicals might be of value as herbicides,
we must await the results of research using radioactive
tracers.</p>
<h2 id="c14">Animal Nutrition and Metabolism</h2>
<h3 id="c15">How Nutritious Are Various Feedstuffs?</h3>
<p>An endless phase of animal nutrition research deals with
efficiency of rations, that is, the pounds gained by the animal
per pound of feed consumed. The standard form of such
research is to feed groups of animals on different rations
for several weeks or months and determine average change
in weight per pound of feed used.</p>
<p>In recent years scientists have used chemical tests to
compare the amount of calcium in the diet against the
amount excreted. The apparent digestibility of such minerals
has thus been computed for different rations. Yet one
important source of error in these chemical tests plagued
researchers.</p>
<p>There is a &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; in nutrients fed to animals; elements
in feed are absorbed into the animal&rsquo;s body, retained
for a time, and later excreted. For example, a cow actually
loses more calcium (through milk and excreta) during the
first six months of milk production than her normal ration
contains. As long as the amount of recycling was unknown,
scientists could not tell, for instance, how much calcium in
alfalfa hay could be digested by simply measuring incoming
and outgoing calcium.</p>
<p>Formerly scientists could study the problem only by withholding
all calcium from the diet. Under this unnatural
condition all outgoing calcium came from the animal&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>With radioactive calcium in a steer&rsquo;s diet (or injected
into the blood), scientists can quickly tell how much of the
excreted calcium comes from the animal&rsquo;s blood and organs
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
under normal conditions. In a typical instance a ration
thought to have 24 per cent digestible calcium, chemically
determined, was found to have 38 per cent by the tracer
technique.</p>
<p>The tracer method shows that milk contains phosphorus,
only 20 per cent of which may come from the feed and 80
per cent from the cow&rsquo;s bones. With eggs, about 65 per
cent of the phosphorus is provided by feed and 35 per cent
by the hen. Radioactive tracers permit measurement of
such &ldquo;biological pathways,&rdquo; as the biochemist calls them.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Can Lean Meat be Estimated &ldquo;on the Hoof&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>The proof of the ration, one might say, is in the cutting.
That is, the worth of a particular feed was formerly unknown
until the carcass had been cut and priced.</p>
<p>Because of the time and expense, researchers in the past
have merely tested groups of animals on a ration for a few
weeks and then estimated the total gain by weighing and
measuring. The main drawback to such a method is that it
measures total growth only. In meat animals, knowing total
growth is less important than knowing how much gain is in
the more valuable lean meat, how much is in fat, and how
much merely water. Techniques based on atomic energy
have provided a new approach without adding radioactive
contamination to the animal.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;background radiation&rdquo; that has existed since the
earth was formed, part comes from cosmic rays (from
outer space) and part from radioactive materials in the
earth itself. One of these naturally radioactive isotopes is
radioactive potassium, which is present to a small but significant
extent in food, in human bodies, and in construction
materials.</p>
<p>While some chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen go into almost every kind of substance in living
things, potassium plays a special role in animals: it lodges
almost exclusively, not in bone or fat or water, but in lean
meat.</p>
<p>Biological and medical researchers are now cooperating
to build &ldquo;whole-body&rdquo; radiation counters. A human being or
an animal is actually enclosed by these huge devices, some
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of which are so sensitive they measure nearly every ray
that emerges from the body. These counters will help answer
many questions, but here only their use to measure
radiopotassium in meat animals is explained. The animal is
fed a test ration containing no added radioactivity. At intervals
of a week or more, the animal is weighed and is also
tested for natural radioactivity. Weighing tells total gain,
while radiopotassium counting shows how much gain is in
the desired lean meat. This method is remarkably simple,
and since no radioactivity is added to its diet, the animal
can still be marketed.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Does Thyroid Affect Milk&mdash;Egg Production?</h3>
<p>Recognition of the significance of the thyroid gland in
animals, the association of iodine with the thyroid, and the
availability of an excellent radioisotope of iodine have resulted
in increased study of this important gland. Chemical
tests had hinted at a link between the thyroid gland and the
production of milk and eggs. Using radioactive iodine, scientists
learned that thyroid activity increases with the onset
of milk and egg formation. In hot weather, when yield
of milk and eggs decreases, activity of the thyroid gland
diminishes.</p>
<p>It may be that a dairy breeder can soon select calves for
potential milk production because of thyroid activity as
measured by radioactive iodine. At present he must let the
animals grow and produce milk for several years before he
chooses those to use in herd improvement. (See <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="c18">More Tracers in Animal Nutrition Research</h3>
<p>Female hormones in microgram amounts<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> accelerate
fattening of cattle and sheep. Before this method can be
used on animals for human consumption, however, it must
be determined that no possible human injury can result
from any residue. With chemical tests the measurement
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of such tiny amounts was impossible. Even with radioactive
carbon-14, doses of hormone 1000 times normal dosage
were required before the hormones in the flesh were
measurable.</p>
<p class="caption small" id="fig_4">Fig. 4&mdash;Future high-producing milk cows may be selected as calves, because of the measured activity of their thyroid glands. A minute amount of iodine-131 is fed and within minutes has concentrated in the thyroid. High concentration means high thyroid activity, which in older animals means high milk production.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">
<img src="images/pag009.jpg" alt="Iodine-131 fed ... concentrates in thyroid." width="500" height="499" />
</div>
<p>Recently an isotope of hydrogen (tritium or H&sup3;) was linked
to hormones, and these were fed in normal amounts to cattle.
Tests 90 days afterward showed less than one part per
billion in the meat, a big step toward cheaper fattening of
meat animals with hormones.</p>
<p>The use of tranquilizers has been proposed for reducing
the customary loss of weight in cattle being shipped to
market. These chemicals, also, are used in such minute
quantities that residues could not be detected except with
radioactive tracers. Tritium can now be used by health
officials to study the effects of tranquilizers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c19">Insects</h2>
<h3 id="c20">Where and How Fast Do Insects Travel?</h3>
<p>Radioactive isotopes have been used to study insects,
their life cycles, dispersion, mating and feeding habits,
parasites, and predators. Several hundred such studies
have been made on dozens of insect species.</p>
<p>With radioactive tracers even the smallest insect becomes
more easily followed. As one example, nearly half
a million mosquito larvae were tagged with radioactive
phosphorus in Canada. Some of the adults from these larvae
were later found as far as seven miles away, but most were
recovered within one-eighth mile.</p>
<p>In a companion study grasshoppers were labeled with the
same isotope. Their average rate of movement was only
twenty-one feet per hour, and after seven days their position
was based entirely on random motions plus prevailing
winds. It seems that grasshoppers have no ability to move
toward food.</p>
<h3 id="c21">How Far Do Insects Carry Pollen?</h3>
<p>This question is of practical importance in knowing how
far to separate seed-fields to maintain pure varieties of
plants. In the past it was studied by the laborious method
of growing a plant having a dominant &ldquo;marker&rdquo; gene for
some visible trait surrounded by plants without the marker.
Seeds from plants at various distances from the marked
plant were grown the following year to see how far the
genetically marked pollen had been carried. Since such
plants are normally cross pollinated, it was difficult to obtain
strains genetically pure for presence or absence of the
marker gene. Also, considerable testing and bookkeeping
were involved.</p>
<p>With tracers the answer may be found in a few days. A
plant is injected with radioactive phosphorus; after a few
days its pollen is highly radioactive. Flowers at various
distances from the tagged plant may be checked daily for
radioactivity. In one study with alfalfa, radioactive pollen
was carried as far as thirty feet by bees, but more than
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
one-third was deposited on plants adjacent to the labeled
one.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Are Predators Used to Destroy Insects?</h3>
<p>With insect pests, as with plant diseases, biological control
is more economical than artificial control. The use of
insecticides too often results in destruction of helpful insects
along with pests. Limited success has been achieved
in breeding certain plants for resistance to insects.</p>
<p>Two important uses of biological control in agriculture
have been made in recent years: importing an insect from
Australia to eradicate a weed in California and disseminating
ladybird beetles to control certain scale insects.</p>
<p class="caption small" id="fig_5">Fig. 5&mdash;Identifying predators that destroy unwanted insects.</p>

<p class="caption small">Larger insects found nearby are checked for radioactivity.</p>
</div>
<p class="caption small">Bumblebee has not eaten radioactive aphids, but mantis has.</p>
<p>Helpful parasites and predators must first be identified
before they can be used. In the case of small or nocturnal
insects, this can be exceedingly troublesome. Tagging the
pests with radioisotopes in order to identify the predators
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
which consume them is much simpler because the most efficient
predators contain the most activity.</p>
<p>With such techniques entomologists have studied insects
and animals which prey on unwanted aphids, mosquitoes,
blackflies, and roaches. Such experiments may lead to a
deliberate increase of certain predators to control injurious
insects.</p>
<p>Radioactive labeling is also valuable in studying helpful
insects. In one case the indolence of drone bees was indicated
by finding that even with adequate syrup in their cage
they still received identical syrup from worker bees in an
adjoining cage!</p>
<h3 id="c23">Can Tracers Measure Spray Residues?</h3>
<p>Any material used on plants or animals to kill insects or
disease organisms must pass rigid inspection to be sure it
does not accumulate in foodstuffs. This is particularly true
of the &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; poisons, those which are fed to plants via
leaves or roots and are carried internally to all parts of
the plant. Such chemicals can be used widely with nonfood
plants such as cotton to kill insects feeding on them.</p>
<p>Combining radioactive labeling with other techniques has
permitted the researchers to show that some compounds
are soon broken down into harmless chemicals&mdash;a big step
toward acceptance for their use on food plants.</p>
<h2 id="c24">Radioisotopes as Radiation Sources</h2>
<p>Earlier in this booklet radioisotopes were compared to
fireflies because they emit flashes of &ldquo;light.&rdquo; Isotopes
serve research in another important way, other than as
tracers.</p>
<p>Suppose you collected all the fireflies within a 100-mile
radius and put them into a glass jar. Instead of an occasional
twinkle, you would now have a steady glow of light.
Similarly immense numbers of radioactive atoms can be
compressed into a small volume to produce steady, intense
sources of radiation. Agricultural research has answered
many questions with the use of such radiation sources.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c25">Can Radiation Produce New Plants?</h3>
<p>Perhaps no biological aspect of atomic energy has so
caught the fancy of the public as the prospect of creating
new plant varieties. There is something mysterious about
pouring invisible energy into seeds or buds and watching
for changes in the emerging leaves and flowers. There is
also the challenge of the lottery in being unable to predict
where, when, or in what form the alterations will appear.</p>
<p>Although the claims of over-enthusiastic gardeners and
seed dealers about astonishing new plants &ldquo;created&rdquo; by
atomic radiation are doubted, clear proof exists even in the
restrained scientific journals of hereditary changes caused
by radiation.</p>
<p>From more than 30 years of scientific study, certain conclusions
have emerged. High-energy radiations can cause
sudden hereditary changes (mutations) in any living thing:
man, animal, microbe, or plant. Any feature of a plant
subject to hereditary control&mdash;root, shoot, leaf, flower, or
fruit&mdash;can be altered by radiation. Most of these changes
are undesirable; they interfere with the normal state of biological
affairs. A very small percentage of mutated organisms
is improved in some way. So far changes cannot
be controlled or predicted.</p>
<p>To date fourteen new strains of crop plants improved by
radiation have been put into production in various parts of
the world. These varieties with their places and dates of
release follow:</p>

<p>In these instances no desirable changes appeared in the
plant grown directly from treated seeds, but they appeared
several generations later. In most cases hundreds of thousands
of plants were examined before the desirable ones
were found. The desired changes were almost always accompanied
by undesirable ones, and years of cross-breeding
and &ldquo;purifying&rdquo; were necessary to obtain usable varieties.</p>
<p>The technique of radiation breeding can be used on any
form of life where large numbers can be grown and discarded
at little cost. The output of penicillin has been increased
a thousandfold by repeated mutations caused in the
microorganism producing this antibiotic. Several studies on
radiation breeding of poultry have been started.</p>
<p>An ingenious reverse twist of induced mutation is being
applied in the field of plant diseases. While some scientists
are irradiating seeds and plants in an effort to obtain
disease-resistant mutations, others are irradiating the
fungi which cause the diseases. They hope in this way to
foresee the new strains of pathogenic microbes that will
occur naturally in order to breed resistant plants before
the new diseases appear.</p>
<p>Some claims have been made that radiation can stimulate
plant growth, germination, earlier maturity, and so on.
Similar benefits are sometimes claimed for human health.
These allegations are almost never proved in reputable
laboratories. It seems likely that radiation is stimulating,
in the words of one authority, &ldquo;only in the sense that a
pruning knife is stimulating.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c26">Can Radiation Destroy Germs and Insects?</h3>
<p>Food technologists have studied ways of preserving food
with radiation for more than ten years. Their findings indicate
that complete sterilization of food with radiation requires
doses so high (2 to 6 million roentgens<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>) that cost
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
is prohibitive at present, and the food often becomes distasteful.
These amounts of energy completely destroy the
microbes and enzymes which normally cause food to putrefy.</p>
<p>If radiation is to be used in preserving food, it will probably
be as a supplement to conventional methods of heating
and freezing. &ldquo;Pasteurizing&rdquo; with radiation to destroy most
(but not all) of the microbes in meat or fruit or vegetables
is accomplished with less than five per cent of the dosage
required for sterilizing. Such treatment does not alter
flavor or texture appreciably and could be used to prolong
the refrigerated &ldquo;life&rdquo; of many fresh foods. It is the responsibility
of the Federal Food and Drug Administration
to determine that no threat to human welfare could possibly
result before approving the use of high-energy radiation to
preserve foods.</p>
<p>With agricultural products stored dry, such as grain,
tobacco, and wool, the chief agents of damage are not microbes,
but insects. The loss of stored field crops caused
by insects is estimated at $200 million annually in the
United States. Deinfesting such goods with radiation doses
in the &ldquo;pasteurizing&rdquo; range promises to be practical and
causes no apparent change in the product.</p>
<p>Like many other foodstuffs, potatoes are often stored for
months between harvest and use. Precaution must be taken
to prevent their deterioration during storage not only from
decay but also from sprouting.</p>
<p>Cold storage inhibits sprouting but is costly and has another
serious drawback. In the making of potato chips,
tubers held at low temperature contain excess sugar and
result in darkened chips. Storage at higher temperatures
prevents conversion of starch to sugar but encourages
sprouting.</p>
<p>Atomic energy promises to resolve this dilemma. Given
low doses of gamma rays (5000 to 10,000 roentgens), potatoes
may be kept at room temperature for a year or more
without sprouting. Similar doses inhibit sprouting of onions.
The estimated cost of irradiating tubers and bulbs at such
doses is as low as 14 cents per ton. No chemical changes
have yet been found in irradiated potatoes that would make
them unsafe for eating. In fact, health officials in Canada
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
have recently approved the use of gamma rays on potato
tubers that will be stored and later used for human food.
Our own Food and Drug Administration has given similar
approval for applying gamma rays to bacon and fast electrons
to wheat (for killing insects).</p>
<p>An ingenious application of atomic energy to agriculture
concerns the screwworm fly, which inhabits large areas of
southern United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The fly
lays eggs in open wounds of livestock, including navels of
newly born, and the burrowing maggots inevitably kill the
animal. In the southeastern United States, damage from this
insect amounted to $15 to $25 million annually.</p>
<p>In the years 1958 and 1959 more than two billion screwworm
flies were deliberately released from airplanes over
the entire state of Florida and parts of Georgia and Alabama.
This astonishing act was a major step in successful
eradication of the pest from southeastern United States.</p>
<p>The entomologists who conceived this remarkable scheme
had the following information from basic studies: the insect
produces a generation about every three weeks. In the
pupal stage males can be sterilized by 2500 roentgens of
X or gamma rays, females by 5000 roentgens. The insect
can be reared in large numbers. Sterile males are fully
competitive with normal males for mates. And, of course,
sterile eggs do not hatch. (It was helpful, though incidental,
that females mate only once.)</p>
<p>After initial tests on an island in the Caribbean, a large
fly-producing plant was set up. Flies were grown to the
pupal stage, irradiated with 8000 roentgens of gamma rays,
permitted to mature, and released from airplanes. With
50 million flies being released weekly over Florida, Georgia,
and Alabama, the area was smothered with sterile
flies, and the number of eggs that hatched (from the normal
native flies) rapidly diminished to zero. The program was
continued for 18 months, and in this time the insect was
completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Certain other insects are being considered for the
sterility-eradication technique. Among them are the boll
weevil, European corn borer, mosquito, and tsetse fly.
Oriental scientists are using gamma rays instead of the
conventional heating to kill silkworms inside cocoons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 id="c27">How Does Radiation Affect Farm Animals?</h3>
<p>At a few colleges of agriculture in this country, radiation
effects on farm animals are being studied.</p>
<p>Although it may not be flattering to be likened to a pig or
a donkey, the fact remains that human beings are physiologically
very similar to swine and burros. These animals
are mammals with simple stomachs and have the same
general size, shape, and placement of organs as do humans.
Radiation studies with swine and burros, although slow and
expensive, should give information more applicable to humans
than the more rapid and inexpensive studies with
small laboratory animals.</p>
<h3 id="c28">What Else Can Radiation Tell Us?</h3>
<p>Two characteristics of soils besides fertility are vitally
important and difficult to measure. These characteristics
are moisture and density. Moisture must be determined
frequently for efficient irrigation. Density controls the pore
space available for water and oxygen; the possible damage
to the soil from tillage and harvesting machines is revealed
by before-and-after tests of density.</p>
<p>Both soil moisture and density were formerly determined
by laboratory methods, which had two drawbacks: the methods
were laborious, and they tested soil in an unnatural
state. Today a sort of double-barreled radiation method
can be used to measure these two soil characteristics.</p>
<p>Neutrons are readily scattered by water but not by soil;
gamma rays are absorbed by both soil and water. In practice
the experimenter drills two holes in the soil a few feet
apart. Into one he puts a gamma-ray source; into the other,
a radiation detector. The reading on his detector dial tells
him the amount of gamma rays absorbed by both soil and
water. Replacing the gamma-ray source with a neutron
source, he obtains a reading on absorption by water only.
The difference between the two readings is ascribed to the
density, or degree of compaction, of that soil in its native
state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c29">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Radioactive tracers and radiation sources have become
indispensable to all phases of agricultural research. They
have helped answer questions that seemed unanswerable.
But there will always be more questions to put to Nature.
The physicists-philosophers of 1890 were confident that
they had obtained all significant knowledge of the physical
universe. Discoveries of the next twenty years revealed
the immaturity of that conviction.</p>
<p>The modern poet Archibald MacLeish has dramatized the
meagerness of knowledge:<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I will tell you all we have learned ...</p>
<p class="t">the lights in the sky are stars</p>
<p class="t0">We think they do not see</p>
<p class="t">we think also</p>
<p class="t0">The trees do not know nor the leaves of the grasses hear us....</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the most characteristic realization of the scientist
today is that the universe is too complex to be fully
described, that concepts must change repeatedly to absorb
new findings, and that the recurring miracle of life is more
majestic than any formula, any computer, or any rocket
that man&rsquo;s brain can devise.</p>

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
